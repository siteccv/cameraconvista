# STEP 2 — CRITICAL CORE ONLY (NO EXTRA FEATURES)

Proceed with implementation, but with STRICT LIMITS.

## Objective of this step
Complete ONLY the core missing foundations required to turn the Admin into a REAL visual CMS (WYSIWYG).
Do NOT implement secondary features.

This step must focus EXCLUSIVELY on:
1) Interactive Admin Preview (click-to-edit)
2) Image editing (desktop vs mobile)
3) Draft / Publish UI logic

Nothing else.

---

## SCOPE — MUST IMPLEMENT

### 1) Real WYSIWYG Admin Preview
- Admin must see the REAL public pages rendered inside Admin.
- Same components as public site.
- Enable an explicit `adminPreview = true` mode.

In adminPreview:
- Clicking on a TEXT opens a modal to edit:
  - IT text
  - EN text
  - font size (desktop)
  - font size (mobile, independent)
- Clicking on an IMAGE / PLACEHOLDER opens controls for:
  - replace image
  - zoom
  - pan / drag
  - reset
- Editing happens directly ON the preview, not via cards or lists.

NO side dashboards.
NO indirect editors.

---

### 2) Desktop vs Mobile Independent Overrides
- Text:
  - Desktop font size ≠ Mobile font size
- Images:
  - Desktop zoom/position ≠ Mobile zoom/position
- Switching device in admin must switch the active editing context.
- Changes must persist correctly to the existing schema.

---

### 3) Draft / Publish — UI wiring
Database fields already exist.
Now wire the UI:

- Page-level:
  - toggle visibility (on/off)
  - “Publish this page” button
- Global:
  - “Publish entire site” button (admin sidebar)
- Public site must render ONLY published content.
- Admin must always see draft content.

---

## HARD CONSTRAINTS (VERY IMPORTANT)

- DO NOT:
  - implement Media Library advanced features
  - implement Google Sheets sync
  - implement SEO UI
  - implement OpenAI translation
  - redesign layouts
  - refactor unrelated code
  - introduce new CMS abstractions

- USE existing schema and components whenever possible.
- Minimal code changes.
- No speculative features.

---

## DELIVERABLES FOR THIS STEP

1) Working WYSIWYG admin preview:
   - texts editable
   - images editable
2) Desktop / mobile overrides proven working
3) Draft / publish working end-to-end
4) Short report:
   - what was implemented
   - which files were touched
   - what is still intentionally NOT implemented

---

## WORK METHOD
- Implement incrementally.
- Prefer clarity over completeness.
- If something is unclear, STOP and ask before proceeding.

Proceed now with STEP 2 only.
