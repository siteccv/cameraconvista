We have partial implementation on Home only. Two critical issues:

1) Font size save does not reflect on page

When I edit the title “Il nostro concept” and change Desktop font size (e.g. 36 → 100), click Save, the value seems saved but the rendered title size does not change.

Goal

Make Desktop/Mobile font sizes persist and apply correctly on Home, with immediate visual update after Save.

Required diagnostics + fixes

Verify persistence layer

Confirm where the “concept title” is stored (DB table/record/field names).

Confirm the Save action actually updates the correct record and fields (desktopFontPx, mobileFontPx or equivalent).

Log the payload sent by the client and the values written in DB.

Verify read/render path

Confirm the Home page reads the updated values from the same source (draft vs published).

Ensure the component uses the correct field and applies it as style={{ fontSize: ...px }} (or tailwind class generation) without being overridden by CSS.

Check if a default value or CSS rule is overriding the inline style (e.g., fixed text-... class, !important, container scaling, etc.).

Cache / state invalidation

If you use React Query/SWR or any caching: ensure invalidate/refetch after Save.

If SSR/loader caching exists: ensure admin updates reflect immediately (no stale cache).

Draft vs Published mismatch

If the admin edits “draft” but the page renders “published”, fix the logic so the admin view renders draft by default (or clearly uses the edited dataset).

For this bugfix, keep changes limited to Home only.

2) Admin “Modifica” vs “Anteprima” mismatch

In admin, the “Modifica” view does not match the final result shown in “Anteprima”. I don’t want two different render pipelines.

Goal

Make admin editing happen directly on the real preview:

The admin should see one single canonical render (what you see is what the user will see).

Editing overlays/modals appear on top of the same UI (no alternate layout, no separate “edit mode page layout”).

Minimal change approach

Keep the existing toolbar buttons if needed, but both “Modifica” and “Anteprima” must render the same exact page component tree, same styling and layout.

The only difference allowed is: in admin, elements become clickable and show edit overlays.

Avoid building parallel components or duplicate pages.

Scope constraints

Apply fixes only to Home for now (concept title + its font sizes).

Do NOT redesign UI, spacing, typography, or break the current aesthetic.

Provide a short technical report at the end:

Root cause (why font size didn’t apply)

How draft/published and admin/public rendering are now unified on Home

How to test quickly

Acceptance tests

Go to /admina → Home → click the concept title → set Desktop font size to 100 → Save.

The title immediately renders at the new size (no refresh needed, but refresh must also keep it).

Switching “Modifica/Anteprima” does not change the layout/rendering; only editing affordances differ.

Public Home (non-admin) remains unchanged except it now reflects the correct published values.

Proceed with implementation now.
