We confirmed that drag-to-move is already implemented and working correctly for images. Good.

Now proceed with the next controlled implementation phase, with strict governance and minimal scope.

1️⃣ Extend text & image management to other pages

Apply the same text and image management logic currently working on Home to the remaining pages, using the same modular and scalable architecture.

Reuse existing components, hooks, and models

Do not duplicate logic

The system must remain:

modular

scalable

consistent across pages

clean (no dead code, no unused files)

For now, it’s acceptable to apply this progressively (page by page), but the architecture must already be shared and reusable.

2️⃣ Mandatory cleanup: remove image-click navigation logic

Before extending the placeholders, you must disable and remove any logic where:

Clicking on an image

Navigates to another page

Or opens a link / route

This is critical because it conflicts with interactive placeholder editing (drag, click, edit).

Rules:

Images must be purely visual

Navigation must happen only via buttons

Remove image onClick, links, wrappers, or route bindings

No fallback logic, no hidden behaviors

Do this cleanly and globally.

3️⃣ Unify placeholder border radius

Apply a single, shared border-radius value to all placeholders in the project.

Requirements:

Slightly more rounded than current value

Same radius everywhere (hero, sections, images, galleries)

Define it once (design token / shared constant / theme variable)

No hardcoded per-component values

This must be visually consistent across desktop and mobile.

4️⃣ Governance rules (mandatory)

Do not introduce parallel systems

Do not leave commented code, TODOs, or debug logs

If a file grows too large, split it cleanly

No behavior changes outside placeholders and text/image editing

No regressions on Home (current working behavior is the reference)

5️⃣ Scope control

No new features

No redesign

No SEO, auth, or routing changes

Focus only on:

extending text/image editing

removing image navigation

unifying placeholder rounding

Proceed step by step, committing only clean, intentional changes.
