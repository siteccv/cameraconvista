We fixed the previous issue. Now we need to evaluate feasibility (no implementation yet) of improving the image positioning UX in the “Edit Image” modal.

Current behavior

To reposition the image inside the placeholder, I must manually edit Offset X / Offset Y fields in the modal.

Desired behavior (UX)

Inside the same “Edit Image” modal:

I want a drag-to-move (“hand/grab”) interaction directly on the preview image (click + drag / touch drag).

Dragging updates the position in real time, and on Save it persists the corresponding offsets (and zoom if relevant).

Desktop and Mobile remain independently editable (tab switch keeps separate transform values).

Task request (analysis/diagnosis only — no code changes yet)

Locate the implementation

Identify the modal component(s) responsible for image editing (URL, zoom slider, Offset X/Y inputs).

Identify the data model fields storing transforms for desktop vs mobile.

Confirm feasibility + best approach

Evaluate whether offsets can be derived from drag deltas reliably (mouse + touch).

Check existing placeholder/hero components: do we already have drag logic elsewhere (e.g., in-place editor / placeholder)? If yes, can we reuse it cleanly without duplicating logic?

Confirm how offsets are defined (pixels vs percent vs normalized), and whether the preview container matches real rendering (to avoid mismatch).

Edge cases

Bounds/clamping: ensure dragging cannot move the image beyond safe limits (avoid empty background).

Interaction with zoom: drag sensitivity should scale appropriately with zoom level.

Mobile: touch gestures shouldn’t conflict with page scroll inside modal.

Accessibility: keyboard fallback is not required now, but do not break existing inputs.

Governance constraints (mandatory)

Keep code clean: no dead code, no duplicate logic, no leftover debug logs.

Respect modularity: if a file grows too much, split into small modules while keeping behavior identical.

Do not change public UI/UX outside this modal.

Provide a clear recommendation and a minimal implementation plan without writing the code yet.
